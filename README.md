This is an AI-based Recommendation System designed using Java. This was one of the most exciting and insightful tasks in the internship, as it introduced me to how AI can be used to personalize user experiences. I had the opportunity to work on building a smart system capable of analyzing user preferences and suggesting relevant products or content — just like how Netflix recommends shows or Amazon suggests products.

Real-World Applications of Recommendation Systems :

Recommendation systems are everywhere in today's digital landscape. They are one of the most powerful uses of artificial intelligence and data-driven personalization. Here are some key areas where such systems are applied:

1.E-commerce Platforms: Sites like Amazon and Flipkart recommend products to users based on past purchases, browsing history, and user ratings.
2.Streaming Services: Platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify use recommendation engines to suggest movies, videos, and music that match user interests.
3.Social Media: Apps like Instagram and Facebook use recommendation algorithms to show relevant posts, friends, and pages.
4.Online Education: Platforms like Coursera and Udemy recommend courses based on a user's skill history and interests.
5.News and Content Apps: Google News and other news aggregators suggest stories based on user interaction and preferences.
6.Job Portals: Platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed recommend jobs based on user profiles and activity.

These systems significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction, and they are critical for businesses to drive conversions and retain users.

Tools and Technologies Used : 

Programming Language: Java
Data Format: CSV (for sample input data)
IDE: VS Code

This task was a huge step toward understanding real-world applications of AI. I learned:

1.How collaborative filtering works in recommending items
2.How to set up and use Apache Mahout in a Java environment
3.How to prepare and structure data for machine learning
4.The importance of data in training models and generating results
5.How scalable and modular recommendation systems can be created

I also got a chance to improve my Maven usage, work with CSV files, and handle basic data preprocessing.

Completing this AI-based recommendation system was an incredible experience. I understood not only the theoretical concept behind recommender systems but also how to practically implement one using industry tools like Apache Mahout. This project simulated real-world use cases like product recommendations and movie suggestions, which are integral to modern AI-driven platforms. This task enhanced my problem-solving abilities and introduced me to the world of machine learning in Java — paving the way for more advanced AI projects in the future.
